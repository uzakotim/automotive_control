% 1) stop as fast as possible
% 2) no use of previous assumptions
% 3) road use, not offroad
% 4) used in Europe
% 5) Car parameters

% How ?
% Plenty of implementations
% Solution -> assignment

% How to develop ABS?
% Automated Braking System

% brake - input
% speed of car - output

% goal - minimize time
% pid - lead to 0 speed of car
% error - (speed_of_car - 0)
% moving it to zero

% What ABS will do?
% Functionalities

% 1)  ABS shall release pressure, when car wheel is locked
% 2)  System shall preserve lateral stability 
% 3)  If ABS is active, driver shall feel oscillation of pedal
% 4)  The system shall inform the driver, when activated
% 5)  Reaction time of the system shall be sufficient
% 6)  There shall be direct connection to breaks
% 7)  If gas pedal and break pedal are both pressed, car shall stop
% 8)  If reverse is on and break pedal are both pressed, car shall stop
% 9)  If stopping at raining or snowing conditions, the system shall preserve both lateral and
% longitudinal dynamics stability
% 10) ABS shall work at any initial speed
